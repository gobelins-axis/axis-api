# Arcade API

The goal is to make it fairly easy to preload resources for both production and development environment and establish the right preloading strategy for any project by choosing precisely what to preload and when. It's also possible to add your own custom loaders.

## Installation

```bash
npm i github:immersive-garden/resource-loader
```

## Usage

## API

## Run demo

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3003
npm run dev
```

## Development

Pushing to master triggers a build via Github Action to create the bundle file.
